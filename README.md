# CBIR_MNIST
In Project, we developed a content-based image retrieval system using the MNIST database. This system was designed to respond to requests for retrieving similar images based on their visual content rather than metadata such as tags or captions. We used the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor to represent the visual content of the images, and a distance matrix to measure the similarity between images. The system was trained with 800 images and tested with 200 images, and the average accuracy was calculated to evaluate its performance in retrieving similar images. The results show that our system is effective in retrieving similar images based on their visual content, demonstrating the potential of using the HOG descriptor and distance matrix for the task of content-based image retrieval. Future work could include optimizing the similarity measurement method and extending the system to larger databases.
